**The Lab is an overview of all available HTML5 tags. The following types of tags are covered:**
- Document setup and metadata
- Semantic structure
- Custom elements and scripting
- Text-level semantics
- Lists and description lists
- Media and embeddings
- Graphics and math
- Forms and controls

**Issues Encountered**
- Often forgetting about closing tags
- Improper nesting of tags (very easy to get wrong)
- Using deprecated elements like marquee even though they're cool and can work
- Misusing attributes
- Over-reliance on br and hr tags but CSS padding will help with this
